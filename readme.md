# Simple_Project
## Intro

After about an 8 month delay, I am back into working with Node, Express and MongoDB. I plan on adding in React down the road to 
my projects as well. This is a very simple MEN stack app which basically has users adding data to a database. 

# Getting started
### Installing

1. Clone the repo
2. Run npm install
3. Start the application with either npm start or nodemon
4. Visit localhost:3000 to see the application

### Technology Stack

1. Node
2. Express
3. Mongo DB

### Operation

The program is quite simple where users enter in basic data to the database and then can delete it.
